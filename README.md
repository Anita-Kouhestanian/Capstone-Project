# Human Detection Using OpenCV
## Objective

Online shopping became so popular recently. we as customers look to brands for guidance. we may spend 3x more when given this guidance in a complete
outfit, furniture set, or beauty look.

FindMine creates visual content for many amazing companies such as Adidas, Cole Haan, and so on. right now, they create all these contents manually.  But manual content creation can only cover a small portion of the catalog, leaving revenue on the table.

For my capstone project, I will help FindMine automates and scales content creation for online retailers. 
In this project, I build different classifiers to identify photos of isolated fashion products vs. human models wearing the fashion products. In other words, the aim is to detect whether a human model is present in product depiction photos. This would not be to determine what products are being depicted. 

## Dataset
The dataset is retail catalog images from multiple photographers/sources depicting fashion, home goods, and beauty products in an XML/JSON/CSV file
format. When human models are present in these types of images, they are partially cropped silhouettes(waist-up, waist-down, etc.) and shot front/back/side profile to emphasize the product being featured.
